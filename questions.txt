Question #91Topic 1
A Software Engineer is trying to figure out why network connectivity to an Amazon EC2 instance does not appear to be working correctly. Its security group allows inbound HTTP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0, and the outbound rules have not been modified from the default. A custom network ACL associated with its subnet allows inbound HTTP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 and has no outbound rules.
What would resolve the connectivity issue?
- The outbound rules on the security group do not allow the response to be sent to the client on the ephemeral port range.
- The outbound rules on the security group do not allow the response to be sent to the client on the HTTP port.
- An outbound rule must be added to the network ACL to allow the response to be sent to the client on the ephemeral port range.

Question #68Topic 2
Auditors for a health care company have mandated that all data volumes by encrypted at rest. Infrastructure is deployed mainly via AWS CloudFormation: however, third-party frameworks and manual deployment are required on some legacy systems.
What is the BEST way to monitor, on a recurring basis, whether all EBS volumes are encrypted?
- On a recurring basis, update all IAM user policies to require that EC2 instances are created with an encrypted volume.
- Configure an AWS Config rule to run on a recurring basis for volume encryption.
- Set up Amazon Inspector rules for volume encryption to run on a recurring schedule.
- Use CloudWatch Logs to determine whether instances were created with an encrypted volume.
Correct Answer: B
Using AWS Config Rules, you can run continuous assessment checks on your resources to verify that they comply with your own security policies, industry best practices, and compliance regimes such as PCI/HIPAA. For example, AWS Config provides a managed AWS Config Rules to ensure that encryption is turned on for all EBS volumes in your account. You can also write a custom AWS Config Rule to essentially "codify" your own corporate security policies. AWS Config alerts you in real time when a resource is misconfigured, or when a resource violates a particular security policy.
